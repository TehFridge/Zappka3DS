## Credits
Big thanks to [Dominik/Domints'a](https://github.com/domints) for his Żappka TOTP code implementation used in the QR Codes.
Big thanks to [Nawias](https://github.com/Nawias) for the [Code 128 Renderer Library](https://github.com/Nawias/bar128-love). It sure made this project so that it could be released. (ŻAPPKA DOES NOT USE BARCODES ANYMORE BUT HE STILL DID A GOOD JOB)
